% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls ) produces:

\title{From Misunderstanding to Cooperation: Understanding and Expressing Intentions Through Non-Verbal Actions}

% AUTHORS


% For initial submission, do not give author names, but the
% tracking number, instead, as the review process is blind.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

% and a second row of one, two or three).

\begin{abstract}
Solving situations of misunderstanding requires two abilities: to build a coherent model of others in order to understand them, and to build a model of "me" perceived by others in order to be understood. Having an image of me seen by others requires two recursive orders of modeling, known in psychology as first and second orders of theory of mind.  It becomes especially difficult to find an understanding when agents don’t have a common language to communicate and have to learn and share each other’s intentions through their behaviors. In this paper, we present a cognitive architecture based on both Reinforcement Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning that aims to reach mutual understanding in multi-agent scenarios. We study different conditions of empathy that lead to cooperation in prisoner's dilemma.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Mutual modeling}

\subsection{Non-recursive approach}

Many ToM-based architecture have been developed in order to study multi-agent behaviors in social games. But so far, most of these applications where limited to first order of modeling (agents does not take into account how they are modeled by others) while higher orders leads to better performances in a range of simple social games (cite ). However, 2nd order (an agent has a model of itself viewed by others) seams sufficient to generate rich social behaviors (cite david). Higher orders (an agent has a model of its own theory of mind imagined by other agents), although they outperform 2nd order in some cases (especially fourth cite Mod) do not seams to bring important advantages (cite nego). \\
We introduce a cognitive architecture enabling second order of modeling. In contrast with previous approaches (cite all highers), this one is not recursive. In recursive modeling (cite rigorous), an agent re-use its own architecture (that allows theory of mind) to model other agents. This would lead to an infinite loop of mutual modeling, known as infinite regress in epistemic logic (clark). In mutli-agent framework, recursions need to be stopped at a given depth. Such approaches have limits: it is difficult to process in parallel reasoning of all agents, it becomes heavy in computation beyond second order of modeling, and different agents or their images (perceived by others) may have different reasoning and may adopt different behaviors facing similar observations.\\
In our non-recursive approach, one agent has three models: a model of itself, a model of others and a model of itself seen by others. None of these models are performing theory of mind. At any instant, the agent updates its three models given his observations and use them to make predictions and decisions.\\

\subsection{Model of itself}

An agent $i$ models itself as a RL agent: at a time $t$, it chooses an action $a^t_i$. Depending on this decision and all other agent's decisions $\{a^t_j\}_{j \neq i}$, it receives an observation $o^t_i = O(a^t_1, a^t_2, .. a^t_n)$ ($n$ being the number of agents) and a reward that only depend on this observation $r^t_i = R_i(o^t)$. Each agent has its own reward function that is unknown by other agents.\\

\subsection{Model of others and itself seen by others}

At the same time, it receives observations of other agents ${o^t_j}$,
